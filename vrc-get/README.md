# Installation

## Using homebrew

If you're using homebrew, you can install vrc-get from my tap via `brew install anatawa12/core/vrc-get`.

Due to lack of star, fork, or watches, I couldn't publish to homebrew core. 
([Homebrew/homebrew-core#122922]) Please star this repository!

## Using `cargo`

If you have [`cargo`][cargo], installing using cargo is the easiest way to install vrc-get.

```bash
cargo install vrc-get
```

## Prebuilt binaries

There's prebuilt binaries on the [release] page.

Download executable file for your platform and place to everywhere you want.
There's no additional requirements for thise binaries. All binaries are compiled statically as possible.

For linux, it's a actually static linked executable.

For windows, only `bcrypt.dll`, `ntdll.dll`, `kernel32.dll`, `advapi32.dll`, `ws2_32.dll`, `secur32.dll`, 
and `crypt32.dll`, which is builtin dlls, are dynamically linked.

For macOS, only `Security.framework`, `CoreFoundation.framework`, `libiconv.2.dylibs`, and `libSystem.B.dylibs`, 
which are macOS-builtin dylibs, are dynamically linked.
